  {
    q: "What's the difference between SEO and AEO?",
    a: "SEO focuses on ranking in traditional search engine results (Google's blue links). AEO focuses on being cited and recommended by AI-powered answer engines like ChatGPT, Perplexity, and Google AI Overviews. They're complementary — good SEO supports good AEO.",
  },
  {
    q: "Is AEO replacing SEO?",
    a: "No. Traditional SEO is still essential. But AEO is an additional layer that's becoming increasingly important as more users shift to AI-powered search. The best approach is both working together.",
  },
  {
    q: "How do I know if I'm appearing in AI answers?",
    a: "I run visibility audits across major AI platforms, testing relevant queries for your industry. You'll see exactly where you're being mentioned — and where you're missing.",
  },
  {
    q: "How long does AEO take to work?",
    a: "It varies. Some improvements (like structured data) can have quick impact. Others (like building brand mentions) take time to influence AI training data. Expect to see meaningful progress within 3–6 months.",
  },
  {
    q: "Can you guarantee I'll be recommended by ChatGPT?",
    a: "No — and anyone who guarantees that is lying. AI systems are complex and constantly evolving. What I can do is optimise every factor within your control to maximise your chances of being cited and recommended.",
  },
  {
    q: "Do I need to do SEO first before AEO?",
    a: "Not necessarily, but they work best together. Strong SEO foundations (quality content, E-E-A-T, backlinks) make AEO more effective. I can assess your situation and recommend the right approach.",
  },
